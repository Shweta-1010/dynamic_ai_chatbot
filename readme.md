# 🤖 DYNAMIC AI CHATBOT  
*A Simple but Dynamic Chatbot using Python, NLP, and Streamlit*

---

## 📘 Project Overview
The **Dynamic AI Chatbot** is a beginner level conversational AI application built using **Python**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Machine Learning (ML)**.  
It can understand user input, detect sentiment, identify intent, and respond contextually with human-like interaction.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **NLP-Based Intent Recognition**  
- Uses keyword-based pattern matching to detect user intent.  
- Extracts key entities using `spaCy`.  

✅ **Sentiment Analysis**  
- Detects if user input is Positive, Negative, or Neutral using `TextBlob`.  
- Adjusts responses based on detected emotion.  

✅ **Contextual Responses**  
- Maintains context of ongoing chat using Streamlit session state.  
- Includes pre-trained responses for FAQs and common queries.  

✅ **Dynamic Information**  
- Responds with current **date** and **time** dynamically.  

✅ **Smart Analytics Dashboard**  
- Tracks chatbot performance using visual analytics.  
- Displays intent frequency and sentiment distribution using `matplotlib`.  

✅ **Data Logging**  
- Every conversation is stored in `chat_logs.csv` for performance tracking and retraining.
